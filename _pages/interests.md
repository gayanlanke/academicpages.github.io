I enjoy reading books, cycling, running, playing chess, listening to podcasts and music, and watching movies. 

Recently, I started reading [Paul Graham Essays](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html) and they are superb. To provide a bit of context, he is a co-founder of YCombinator. Few of my personal favourites are:

* [Makers' Schedule, Manager's Schedule](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) (Yes, I hate having too much meetings :worried:)
* [How to get new ideas](https://paulgraham.com/getideas.html)
* [Cities and Ambition](https://paulgraham.com/cities.html)


## My top book recommendations

* Slow Productivity by Cal Newport
* Deep Work by Cal Newport
* A World Without Email by Cal Newport
* Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari
* Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl
* Atomic Habits by James Clear
* Animal Farm by George Orwell
* Outliers by Malcom Gladwell
* 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey

## The podcasts that I enjoy the most

* Deep Questions with Cal Newport (superb)
* Acquired (I love the accents of Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal)
* Lex Fridman podcast
* Tim Ferris Show


## My favourite movies

* Inception
* Interstellar
* Parasite
* Batman movies

**Note**: I would watch any movie directed by Christoper Nolan and Quentin Tarantino. Furthermore, I would listen to any piece composed by Hans Zimmer.
