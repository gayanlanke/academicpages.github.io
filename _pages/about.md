I am a final year PhD student working with [Dr. Rahul Sharma](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/2660), [Prof. Tapan Saha](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/83) and [Dr. Ruifeng Yan](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/2201) in the [Power, Energy and Control Engineering research group](https://www.itee.uq.edu.au/research/power-and-energy-systems) at The University of Queensland, Australia. My PhD project focusses on developing advanced control schemes for residential customers to effectively utilise their distributed energy resources in demand management and electricity market services. I am broadly interested in grid integration of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources, active distribution network management, demand response, distributed optimisation and robust control.
