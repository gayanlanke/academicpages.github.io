I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Power, Energy and Control Engineering](https://www.itee.uq.edu.au/research/power-and-energy-systems) research group at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/), Australia and an adjunt Senior Research Specialist at [SolarisAI Pty Ltd](https://www.solarisai.com). The project focusses on developing an all-in-one system that automatically detects and locates faulty or under-performing photovoltaic (PV) panels in utility-scale solar farms. My current research work involves developing predictive maitenance algorithms for the early detection of inverter and tracker motor failures in utility-scale solar farms.


## Research Interests

- Grid integration of distributed energy resources
- Reliability analysis and Operations and Maintenance Optimisation of utility-scale solar farms
- Machine learning applications in power systems
