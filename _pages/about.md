I am a PhD student at the [Power and Energy Systems Research Group](https://www.itee.uq.edu.au/research/power-and-energy-systems) at The University of Queensland, Australia. My research work is mainly focussed on the development of control algorithms for behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs) to participate in demand management and electricity market services under uncertainties. I am working under the supervision of Dr. [Rahul Sharma](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/2660), Dr. [Ruifeng Yan](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/2201) and Prof. [Tapan Saha](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/83). I am broadly interested in the demand side management, electricity markets and grid integration of distributed energy resources.
