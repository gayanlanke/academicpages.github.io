I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Power, Energy and Control Engineering](https://www.itee.uq.edu.au/research/power-and-energy-systems) research group at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/), Australia. My project focusses on developing an all-in-one system that automatically detects and locates faulty or under-performing photovoltaic (PV) panels in utility-scale solar farms. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the same university under the supervision of Dr. Rahul Sharma, Prof. Tapan Saha and Dr. Ruifeng Yan. I am broadly interested in grid integration of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources, demand response and control and machine learning applications in power systems.

I am a final year PhD student working with [Dr. Rahul Sharma](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/2660), [Prof. Tapan Saha](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/83) and [Dr. Ruifeng Yan](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/2201) in the [Power, Energy and Control Engineering research group](https://www.itee.uq.edu.au/research/power-and-energy-systems) at The University of Queensland, Australia. My PhD project focusses on developing advanced control schemes for residential customers to effectively utilise their distributed energy resources in demand management and electricity market services. I am broadly interested in grid integration of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources, active distribution network management, demand response, distributed optimisation and robust control.
