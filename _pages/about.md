I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Power, Energy and Control Engineering](https://www.itee.uq.edu.au/research/power-and-energy-systems) research group at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/), Australia and an adjunt Senior Research Specialist at [SolarisAI Pty Ltd](https://www.solarisai.com). The project focusses on developing an all-in-one system that automatically detects and locates faulty or under-performing photovoltaic (PV) panels in utility-scale solar farms. My current research work involves developing predictive maitenance algorithms for the early detection of inverter and tracker motor failures in utility-scale solar farms.
I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Queensland under the supervision of A/Prof Rahul Sharma, Prof. Tapan Saha and A/Prof  Ruifeng Yan.
