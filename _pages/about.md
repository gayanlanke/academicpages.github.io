I am a final year PhD student in the [Power, Energy and Control Engineering Research Group](https://www.itee.uq.edu.au/research/power-and-energy-systems) at The University of Queensland, Australia. My PhD project focusses on developing advanced control schemes for residential customers to effectiviely utilise their distributed energy resources in demand management and electricity market services. I am working under the supervision of Dr. [Rahul Sharma](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/2660), Prof. [Tapan Saha](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/83) and Dr. [Ruifeng Yan](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/2201). My research interests include grid integration of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources, demand response, distributed optimisation and robust control.
