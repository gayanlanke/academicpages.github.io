Distribution Systems Engineering (EE 662) course is taught in semester 1 of the M.Sc. Eng. in Power Applications program for the year 2023.

Gave lectures on the Distribution Lines section of EE 662 (Distribution Systems Engineering) course of the M.Sc. Eng. in Electrical Power Applications program. The topics covered in these lectures were as follows:

- Voltage drop, K-factor, and power loss in distribution lines.
- Different types of distribution lines.
- Considerations for overhead distribution lines.
- Understanding resistance and reactance in distribution lines.
- Series impedance of transposed lines.
- Self and mutual impedance of untransposed distribution lines.
- Shunt admittance of overhead distribution lines.
- Distribution system line models.

These topics aimed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of distribution lines and their various characteristics and considerations in electrical power applications.
